Nginx Webmin Module
===================

**Description:**

This Nginx Webserver module is based on the original Webmin module developed by [Justin D Hoffman](https://www.justindhoffman.com/project/nginx-webmin-module), however this version has been optimized for FreeBSD and/or FreeBSD/Jailed Nginx environments.

*Configure Nginx settings through the Webmin interface for convenience.*

**Features:**

- Full text-area editing on config files.
- Ability to setup and maintain virtual servers.
- Maintain nginx configuration.
- Start, reload, and stop server.

**FreeBSD Support**
 Currently tested under FreeBSD 12 with a standalone Nginx server installation, as well as tested with Nginx installed under a secure [BastilleBSD](https://bastillebsd.org/) container, though it should work with most FreeBSD jail/container managers, making it suitable for a jailed FEMP Stack setup.
